. Multiple symbol table entities may be associated with a class declaration. (Pace picks a representative and uses a map to share
. Sizeof operation not always computed correctly.  Dan will assign someone to fix this
. No Size info available for structures. Also, the get_PackingAlignment() function of SgFunctionDefinition always yields 0.
. Switch statement not translated correctly when some of the cases are nested. See example switch5.c.
. Array size not computed even when it can be inferred from initialization data:
    char first_name[] = { 'B', 'a', 'r', 'a', 'c', 'k' },
         last_name[] = "Obama";
. SgTypeUnsignedLong not identified as isUnsignedType
. Sometimes a bad cast expression (with two sibling operand subtrees) is created for string actual arguments (to memcpy).
. No boolean type support - C does not support boolean 
. No conversion (from pointer to integer) provided for pointer subtraction. More importantly, the result of substracting
  2 pointers yields a pointer type instead of an integer type. This problem can ripple through a whole expression...
. When a pointer that returns void* contains a return statement with the value null. That value is represented as the integer value and typed as an integer pointer instead of being casted to void*.
. No support for bit-fields?
