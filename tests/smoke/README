This directory is the root of all "smoke" tests for the ROSE library.

Smoke tests are always distributed as part of the main ROSE repository
and are meant to lightly test the most basic features of software
distributed as part of that repo.

Smoke tests are run by "make check". In total, the smoke tests should
take only a few minutes on average hardware.

Think carefully about placing tests, checkers, or specimens under this
directory. Most things should go into the nonsmoke sibling directory
instead.
