# Tests for various file name extensions.

# Rather than play escaping tricks with make and the shell, we replace the special characters with non-special
# characters and then insert the special characters at the very last second in the translator. For instance, the name
# "foo+STAR+bar.c" expands to "foo*bar.c". See translator.C for details since that's where the unescaping happens.

# These names have been removed from the following lists for various reasons given here. The reasons are not meant to be
# exhaustive, they're just where we first noticed the problem now that the tests have been rewritten so they actually
# test something (previously the test ran but we never considered the result). [Matzke 2016-05-19]
